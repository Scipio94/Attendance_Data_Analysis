# Data Cleaning With SQL

## Description

One of my most recent projects was to calculate attedance percentages of the employees at my job. We use a software that generates duplicates that makes it extremely difficult to calculate attedance averages. So, I used SQL to 'clean' the data make it possible to calculate an employee's attendance percentage. 

## Variables

There are several variables in the dataset that had an effect on the outcome of the calculation of an employee's attendance percentage

- **Employee ID**: Employee's identification number
- **Department Name**: The department that employee works in
- **Date**: Date of the Absence
- **Absence Type**: Reason why the employee was absent on a given date
